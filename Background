In this programming project, we will implement backpropagation for LSTMs. 
For simplicity, we excluded biases and are using a very short input sequence. 
The code implements a 1-layer, long short-term memory (LSTM) network. 
We need to implement forward pass and backpropagation, i.e., the fp() and backprop() functions. 
In gdonestep(), there is code to numerically check whether the gradients are computed correctly.
