Background: 2D total variation denoising is most often used in digital image processing to remove noise. 
By minimizing the particular cost function for the TV filter, we can then get the ideal denoised image. 
Instead of merely do the operation on one vector, we need to operate each row and column of matrix(image). 
The two famous total varition methods are isotropic method and anisotropic method. 
We used anisotropic methods which calculate the norm 1 of the difference. 
In this project, we mainly searched and implemented two different methods to denoise a noisy-image. 
They are CNN and ROF. In the result result, we will also discuss the performance of each algorithm.
